## Overview

### Description

A small borrowed books tracking app made as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum, with added functionality to keep track of dates when books are due to be returned. User can add, edit and delete book records, and track the read and returned status. The app uses local storage, so the book records are stored between sessions.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (7-in-1 architecture)
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### The process

The project's purpose is to get familiar with the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript, but I also used it as a training ground for other web development techniques.

This project uses templating method (the HTML "template" element) to clone a "card", instead of creating a new one each time a new book is added. 

The "dialog" element is used instead of confirm prompt for deletion.

### Continued Development

- [x] Add storage;
- [ ] Check due dates against current date;
- [ ] Add filters and pagination, maybe search;
- [ ] Add animations;
