## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### The process

This project uses templating technique to clone a "card" element instead of creating a new one each time a new book is created. 

Dialog element is used instead of confirm prompt for deletion.
